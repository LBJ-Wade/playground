A repo for random prototype codes, experiments, miscellaneous numerical tools, etc.

This isn't really organized any way. Just feel free to drop things here if you think other people might be interested.

File Descriptions
=================

 - `Mathematica_IO_Behavior.nb` - Testing how quickly Mathematica will read in different file formats. Compressed HDF5 typically wins. Actual output files are (should be) ignored in .gitignore.
 - `Burgers_Equation_Solvers.nb` - A Mathematica notebook implementing a few different methods for solving the inviscid Burgers' equation, including center and forward differencing, and WENO schemes.
 - `Boosted_Ellipses.nb` - An interactive Mathematica notebook for visualizing how ellipses (eg, galaxies observed on the sky) deform under a boost
 - `Stokes_Basis_Boost.nb` - An interactive Mathematica notebook showing how measurements of vector quantities behave under a boost.
 - `Light_Deflection_Visualization.nb` - A sketch of gravitational bending of light, without being quantitatively correct.
 - `Penrose_Diagram_Transformations.nb` - The filename is pretty good on this one.
 - `Coffee_Statistics.nb` - Statistics for some of the voting data from the coffee website.
 - `Cartogram_Equalization.nb` - A Mathematica notebook for distorting images by equalizing some property.
 - `Planck_Colormaps.py` - Construct Planck color maps for use with matplotlib in Python.  Derived from HEALPix code.
