A repo for random prototype codes, experiments, miscellaneous numerical tools, etc.

This isn't really organized any way. Just feel free to drop things here if you think other people might be interested.

File Descriptions
=================

 - `Mathematica_IO_Behavior.nb` - Testing how quickly Mathematica will read in different file formats. Compressed HDF5 typically wins. Actual output files are (should be) ignored in .gitignore.
 - `Burgers_Equation_Solvers.nb` - A Mathematica notebook implementing a few different methods for solving the inviscid Burgers' equation, including center and forward differencing, and WENO schemes.
